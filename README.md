# 18F portfolios microsite

This repository houses a microsite about 18F's portfolios. We use the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for the front end interface. The site is built and served through [the Federalist platform](https://federalist.18f.gov/).

### Adding a portfolio project

Projects are stored in the [_portfolio_projects](./_portfolio_projects) Jekyll collection. Currently, there are two general types:

Single page overviews are...single page overviews. The body of the page is a narrative about the project, and YAML metadata is used to fill in the sidebar and for filling small bits of information around the site. For an example, see the [Air Force Material Command project](./_portfolio_projects/afmc.md), which builds into [this page on the site](https://portfolios.18f.gov/projects/afmc/).

Project microsites are more customizable and allow projects to set up their own site structure. Currently, they're set up using a combination of a Jekyll layout and a few markdown files. For an example, the Eligibility APIs microsite is built from [a custom layout](./_layouts/hs-api-page.html) and pages that use that layout, [starting from a "home" page](./_portfolio_projects/hs-apis-home). This can likely just be duplicated and edited, though a ready-to-use template is on the roadmap.

## Installation and Deployment

Run each of the following steps to get the site up and running:

1. `git clone git@github.com:18F/portfolios`
2. `cd portfolios`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`

You should be able to see the site at: http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## System security controls

The site is a static website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Deployments are done through Federalist.

1. Federalist runs in its own organization and space in [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/), which piggybacks on [AWS GovCloud](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/).
1. Federalist Admin: https://federalist.18f.gov/.
1. Federalist responds to a webhook on GitHub and runs Jekyll to generate static web files and puts them in an S3 bucket.
1. We map portfolios.18f.gov URL to the S3 bucket.
