The National Geo-spatial Intelligence Agency GEOINT Services product teams wanted to identify the problems that hindered their ability to provide agile delivery and great customer experiences across the enterprise. GEOINT Services sought a vision for  product teams, analysis of how their teams are currently structured, recommendations for how to restructure and empower product teams, and how best to procure product support. 

## What did we do

GEOINT chose 18F to analyze their existing product management and procurement practices and provide recommendations on how to better serve their end-users. The five-week engagement was comprised of onboarding to understand the organization’s needs and pain points, and research of GEOINT Services product teams. During this time, 18F conducted interviews with 12 GEOINT representatives including employees and stakeholders from Contracts, Legal, GEOINT Services, and the Integrated Program offices to help gain a deeper understanding of their needs.

## What were the findings or recommendations

Research identified three problems that NGA needed to address.

- GEOINT Services’ product choices are not being driven by end-user needs, product development lacks sufficient end-user input, and there are too many products in flight
- GEOINT Services does not have stable, dedicated resources. Developers are frequently reassigned, product managers are spread too thin, and contracting officer support is ad hoc.
- NGA’s commercial / noncommercial determinations add years of delays to the procurement process, prescribe detailed requirements that prevent agile development, and unnecessarily reduce the pool of available vendors.

## The Results

During the engagement, the GEOINT Services team communicated that their goal is to deliver products and services that meet the needs of their users and gain wider adoption.  Armed with the recommendations that we provided and their demonstrated willingness to adjust course with each new learning, the GEOINT Services team is well on their way to better address their customer needs through improved product management practices.
