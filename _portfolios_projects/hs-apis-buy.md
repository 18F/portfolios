## Build flexibility and reuse into your procurement language

If your program would benefit from **systems that are more flexible and easier to update**, consider embedding API-driven development into your procurement language.

These Sample System Requirements and sample Quality Assessment Surveillance Plan (QASP) elements may help you guide vendor teams towards flexible and reusable software development.

Consider embedding API-oriented criteria like these into every phase of the process, from the initial RFP, to evaluation and eventual post-award surveillance.

### Sample Requirement

<div class="background-gray pad-top-bottom pad-right-left" markdown="1">
The System must:

+ Incorporate an application programming interface (API) strategy to promote system flexibility and interoperability.
    + The API strategy should specify:
        + How APIs will connect major system components internally
        + What public or private APIs the system will support
        + Initial users of public or private APIs
        + Potential future users of public or private APIs
    + The API strategy should be iterative and updated based on changing requirements and user needs.
</div>

### Sample Quality Assessment Surveillance Plan (QASP) element

| Deliverable | Performance Standard(s) | Acceptable Quality Level | Method of Assessment |
| ----------- | ------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| API-driven  | Any public or private APIs developed as part of the project will be well-documented and semantically versioned. | All API endpoints, parameters, defaults, and outputs documented and updated at the end of every applicable sprint. Semantic versioning will be kept up to date at the end of every applicable sprint. | All API endpoints, parameters, defaults, and outputs documented and updated at the end of every applicable sprint. |

These sample elements are starting points for requiring API-driven development. Depending on the nature and needs of the project, additional QASP elements could include:

+ API usability testing with developers
+ API availability requirements
+ API design requirements
