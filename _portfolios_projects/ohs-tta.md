summary: Improving the grant oversight process for programs that provide training and technical assistance across Head Start and Early Head Start programs

start_date: September 2019

end_date: present

current: true

people:
- Matt Dobson

- Ryan Ahearn
- Randy Hart
- Carrie Feher

roles:
- Product Management

categories:
- path analysis
- experiment and iterate
- assisted acquisition
- data platform

problems:
- Disconnected data systems which use manual & offline processes
- No complete picture of how TTA is used or success metrics
- Lack of clear & consistent reporting because planning and tracking is not coordinated

approach:
- Stakeholder and user research across levels and regions
- Scoping a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on real user stories
- Hiring a vendor to build the complete production system through an Assisted Acquisition

hypothesis:
- Centralizing the Training & Technical Assistance (TTA) request and activity tracking process will help elevate insights into TTA activities happening across their region and provide more effective help for their Head Start grantees.

## What we’ve learned so far

Today, much of the data related to TTA activity isn’t readily available to the TTA Central Office.

### Communication is inefficient

Lack of integrated data sources make it hard to know what action is happening at glance. Communication is dependent on informal human systems.

### Lack of coordination

Lack of visibility in different parts of the system can result in duplication of efforts.

### Mismatch of resources and needs

Resources developed by the National Centers may not meet Regional needs as they shift from year to year.

### Progress is hard to quantify

It is difficult to measure or track any success metric over time.

## What’s next

<div class="project-story-left">
  <p>Through our research and initial prioritization of opportunities, we’ve determined that the ‘Activity Reporting & Analysis’ phase in the TTA process is a good place to begin exploring solutions. An MVP focused on Program Specialists is an opportunity to digitize the TTA request process which will provide a centralized place where these users can track activity through to completion and get a more complete view of progress over time and across topic areas.</p>

## Why this matters

<div class="project-story-left">
  <p>The office of Head Start Division of TTA and Comprehensive Services team always look first for work that can translate, ultimately, into better outcomes for children and families.</p>
  <p>A more comprehensive, real-time view of TTA activities at the Regional level will enable Program Specialists to be more effective at making decisions to support grantee success.</p>
</div>

More successful Head Start grantees translates to better quality and quantity of services delivered to children and families.
