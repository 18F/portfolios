The 412th Operations Group of the Air Force Material Command (AFMC) was looking for help to modernize their legacy Center Ops Online (COOL) system, which had been developed over the past 19 years and was ready for a holistic user-based refresh. AFMC was specifically seeking to upgrade COOL to provide a web-based platform that would ensure current, qualified, available air crew were able to be scheduled for and execute test missions.

## What did we do

The AFMC selected to work with 18F on the COOL 2.0 project as a multi-phase engagement consisting of both a Path Analysis (research phase) and an Experiment and Iterate (E&I) phase. During the Path Analysis a series of stakeholder and end user interviews were conducted, workflow mapping, process assessment, and a high level UX audit was performed to identify the main problems in modernizing the COOL system.

## What were the findings or recommendations

From the 18F analysis, AFMC COOL team learned that their overarching problem of **unintuitive, inflexible, interdependent, system-driven processes affects all AFMC squadron flight ops functions.** Furthermore, the impact is a **disproportionate amount of time spent** navigating system limitations to accomplish regular, repetitive, administrative tasks in order to execute their missions.

The partners agreed that the best way to make inroads was to start on a smaller scale. The focus of the E&I was to focus on prototyping a small portion of the scheduling module that would affect just aircrew and schedulers. The minimal viable product (MVP) was identified as a redesign aircrew schedule input, display, and integration across modules. The prototype addressed specific pain points, was quantifiable, and it was easy to scope and test. The partner hoped these efforts would be scalable and inadvertently influence the communication strategy, collaboration, and possibly architecture of some of the systems in the DoD.   

## The Results

During the 12-week E&I, the AFMC team worked alongside 18F and practiced working in an agile, human-centered fashion as they focused on refreshing the capability around the calendar. A designated user experience lead worked with an 18F UX researcher and designer to establish a “COOL Improvement User Group”. The bulk of the developers’ time was spent setting up and testing the new pipeline. The team was successful in moving the desktop and mobile calendaring tool prototype to the cloud.
