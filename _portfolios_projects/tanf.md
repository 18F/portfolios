## Problem

TANF’s data reporting system is over 20 years old, and using it has been frustrating for states, tribes, and territories as well as federal staff. They spend a considerable amount of time getting the data ready for submission: cleaning and formatting data, pulling data from multiple sources, and internally collaborating on submission. 

That takes time and energy that could otherwise go to deeper analysis and investigation of the data to better administer the program and serve low-income families receiving TANF benefits.

It’s also harder to take advantage of security best practices with a legacy system.

  Just thinking about this latest caseload report and how much time we spend following up with states… Every quarter we're supposed to publish caseload data, and it involves dozens of emails back and forth.

## Approach

* Coached the OFA team on product development and technical oversight skills to manage a new IT system
* Conducted user research with TANF grantees to identify pain points of the old data reporting system
* Hired a vendor to build the new system focusing on open source, DevOps practices, security, and accessibility.
* Hired a Tech Lead in the OFA office to oversee the project and ensure the agency is still delivering on their mission. 
* Collaborated with OFA and the vendor team to achieve a 3-year moderate ATO for the new system.

  Visibility! We have visibility into our system now. We understand how it works and what levers we need to be paying attention to.

## Impact 

Replacing the legacy system will not only decrease burden for TANF grantees and federal staff, but also improve data quality and ultimately help the 1.1 million low-income families who receive cash assistance.

  We have so many issues and questions to deal with related to how our legacy system handles data. I would love to get to a place where we have more time to ask and answer deeper questions about our programs and the families they serve.

## What we learned

* It takes time for agency partners to gain confidence in product ownership, for vendors to learn all the context we’ve been swimming in, for everyone to navigate and improve the ATO process. But taking longer does not mean failure! 
* Building is the best way to learn! In future acquisition projects, we’d suggest building an initial prototype with the agency partner before onboarding a vendor. 
* It takes time to find the right mix of people on a vendor team: full-time designers, engineers, security experts; but thankfully our contract gave us the flexibility to navigate turnover on the vendor team.
* It always helps to have simultaneous projects in the same space—we shared learnings as much as possible with another 18F team working with the Office of Head Start on an assisted acquisition project.
* We push agencies to be modern and agile, and so much of this learning curve falls on the product owners at our partner agencies. It’s a lot—and they often don’t even have full-time bandwidth to dedicate to the project.  Look for ways to distribute that work between the Product Owner and a vendor Product Manager, and ideally bring on a Tech Lead at the partner agency early in the process.

## What's next

TTS is overseeing the vendor contract and providing some lightweight support to the OFA team (just a few hours per month). OFA’s Product Owner and Tech Lead are now managing the project and overseeing the vendor day to day, now that they have in-house digital capacity to do so.
