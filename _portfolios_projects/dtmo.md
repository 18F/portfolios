The Defense Travel Management Office’s (DTMO) website provides an inventory of travel information for Department of Defense (DoD) Service members and civilian staff, but limited insight into how visitors engage with the website has created usability problems and inconsistent user experience. 

## What did we do

DTMO chose 18F to perform a series of assessments including  a high-level content audit and website analytics of the DTMO website; A high-level strategic evaluation of the organization’s customer-focused and technology processes; Discovery research via workshops and interviews across the DOD with internal staff to learn more about how they travel and utilize DTMO tools and resources. 

## What were the findings or recommendations

The DTMO team learned their website had two key user groups 
- **Travelers** are primarily interested in being guided through complex processes
- **Travel administrators** — who support travelers — need to find nuanced information obscured inside complex policy documents.
	
Addressing the specific needs of these two primary user groups was vital to the sites’ success. Our final recommendations to the DTMO team were focused on: 
1. Reorganize how resources are presented by who they are for
   - Develop new templates
2. Create content in a way that is digital first (but not digital only)
3. Use lightweight tools — like Federalist and the U.S Web Design System — to get feedback from users and prioritize new features.

## The Results

In between phases, the DTMO team was able to get a head start on inventory of existing website content. They migrated to using Microsoft word style sheets, developing a regular cadence of collaborative editing with subject matter experts, the communications team began reviewing  site analytics more frequently, and trained subject matter experts (SMEs) in user centered web writing.
