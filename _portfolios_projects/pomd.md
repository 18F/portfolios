[The *Product Owner, M.D.* (POMD) course](https://federalist-b09e389b-5963-437f-bfdf-a065b9fa71cb.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/health-tracking-course/) is, first and foremost, about building community amongst your team. Second, it builds that team's understanding of how to monitor and manage the health of IT projects.

The course is 21 lessons, where each lesson frames a critical dimension of an IT project's health. It is tied directly to the [health tracking rubric](https://federalist-b09e389b-5963-437f-bfdf-a065b9fa71cb.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/health-tracking-course/rubric/) (in miniature, at right) is a powerful tool for framing questions to vendors and project teams, with a simple "red/yellow/green light" framing for each dimension. 

A team can start by working through just four lessons, each touching on a critical dimension of the health rubric. Each lesson takes agencies deeper into the world of product ownership, allowing teams to engage in timely, transformative learning.

<div class="small-caps">Value proposition</div>
By aligning a team on the practice of *questioning process and outcomes*, the POMD course develops lasting, transferrable skills for project oversight and ownership. The *POMD* course helps product owners "call bullshit" on projects that are failing to deliver success on a week-to-week and month-to-month basis. 

The course focuses product owners along four critical dimensions of IT project health:

* Outcomes-orientation
* Team Capacity
* Procurement flexibility
* Iterative development

The course sets four "big picture" learning goals for you and your team:

1. **Assessing health**. Is my state is on track for success?
2. **Questioning and listening**. Is a vendor bullshitting me?
3. **Process and action**. What steps can I take to improve project outcomes?
4. **Self and community**. Am I confident in my work?

The word “bullshit” has a [long, rich history](https://www.etymonline.com/word/bull?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_18053). It’s root, bull, comes potentially from the Old French (bole) or Icelandic (bull), generally meaning to deceive or trick, or in the Icelandic, “nonsense.” In 1600’s English, it might mean “a ludicrous blunder involvving a contradiction in terms.”

I found the course very helpful and believe it will be a big success for our team and new folks who join us. One thing I really appreciated was the different methods used to deliver the content, reading, video, conversation, etc. You and your team did an excellent job.

<div class="small-caps">Using the materials</div>

The POMD course it is most effective for organizational transformation when facilitated in small groups. **Learning in a group builds team cohesion, networks of support, and a shared ownership of mission and vision in a department or agency**. Participants spend 1-2 hours every week in viewing, reading, and reflective writing alone or in pairs. Then, for an hour each week, the group comes together to share, discuss, and explore how the material of the week impacts their day-to-day work. 

The [learning cohort model](https://federalist-b09e389b-5963-437f-bfdf-a065b9fa71cb.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/health-tracking-course/admin/learningcohorts/) is well documented and supported by decades of educational research. Our values and rationale that drove course development are documented as part of the course, so you (and your team, or an outside instructional designer) can leverage them and put them to work yourselves.

We carried that level of detail down to the individual lesson: each lesson provides complete scaffolding for the individual learning, the pair-wise work, and the cohort conversation at the end of the week.
