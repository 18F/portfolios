## We help agencies transform and modernize digital systems across government.

National defense and intelligence agencies are responsible for keeping our country safe.  With countless security threat types to prevent, these agencies need to adopt new technology and digital solutions that will allow them to fulfill their mission and operate more efficiently. Our national security customers include soldiers, sailors, airmen, federal civilians as well as [researchers](https://www.homelandsecurity.noaa.gov/role.html), [scientists](https://www.energy.gov/national-security-safety), [diplomats](https://www.state.gov/), and [doctors](https://www.cdc.gov/)—who are all focused on applying technology and science to ensure our national security.
