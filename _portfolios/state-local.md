Our team of designers, web developers, and acquisition specialists are federal employees working with federal, state, and local agencies. Agencies we’ve worked with or are currently working with:

## We partner with state and local governments to help with the following:

### Expert technical advice
- Design processes to migrate securely off a legacy system without compromising current functionality
- Ensure quality control through so that commercial best practices in agile and user centered design are followed
- Coach staff on how to manage agile software teams
</div>
</div>
</div>
Some projects of course fall outside of these categories, but it’s a good way to think about our work. For 18F to partner with state & local agencies, our work together must involve federal funding and be scoped to agile acquisition consulting.

## Our partnerships can support a variety of projects:

### Short term: Technical Advisors
18F staff can provide short term support (under 80 hours) to assist governments in need of advice on technical strategy.

### Medium term: ‘Tiger Teams’
Three-month engagements with a team of 2-3 digital experts (spanning skills like engineering, design, product and data strategy) to support the scoping, budgeting and vetting of a technology vendor team.

### Long term: Digital Consulting
Longer-term (3-12 month) agile and user-centered engagements, geared toward legacy modernization procurements and transformation in your ability to procure agile software teams.
